Intro

This project is inspired by the
[Ice Path](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ice_Path)
of Pokémon Gold and Silver.

I remember being 11 years old and feeling impressed with this new kind of
puzzle. Regular mazes no longer seemed so interesting. My Nan and I often made
puzzles for one another when I visited, and I wanted to introduce her to the
ice path. But my ice mazes weren't clever enough. Either a maze had too many
ways through it, or the single solution was obvious. Soon I realized that
regular mazes are much easier to create.

Recently the ice path returned to my attention. I would like to make it easy
for people to enjoy this.


How to play
-----------

An ice maze may be drawn on grid paper: Some tiles are filled-in (obstacles),
and some are blank (ice). One tile is marked as the entrance, and another as
the exit.

The player begins by placing a finger on the entrance, and moving the finger
upward, downward, leftward, or rightward along blank tiles until reaching the
tile before a filled-in block. Thus the player slides along the ice, until
hitting an obstacle. Then repeat, choosing a new direction, until the exit is
reached. The player would slide _through_ the exit if there were no subsequent
block in the direction of the slide; to solve the maze, the player must stop
on the exit tile.


An ideal maze
--------------

* Has a single solution, no short-cuts
* Has forks, dead-ends, and hidden traps along the way
* Should be deceptively simple,
  so players go in circles wondering "What am I missing?"


Features
--------

* Create mazes in the browser
* Ice tiles, Walkable tiles, Obstacle tiles
* Play using the arrow keys in the browser
* Option to view solutions, dead-ends, and traps in the browser


Plans
-----

* Print to paper
* Option to automatically generate mazes to meet user-defined criteria
* Drag-and-drop to reposition entry and exit
* Option to resize (extend or crop) by dragging on an edge of the maze
* Pokémon GS theme with alternative sprites to design fancy maps
* Use browser storage as a way to save and load mazes locally
* Support tablet touch swipes to move player during play mode
* Possibly implement an isometric theme later
